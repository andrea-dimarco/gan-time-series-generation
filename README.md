# Time-Series Generation with GANs

**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS**
Training GANs to generate time series of highly dimensional systems that are hard to simulate with a different model.

Highly inspired by [this](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RHZs3GqLBwg) pubblication.

In the future I will also include adversarial attacks on the system as suggested by [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10755) pubblication.
