# Time-Series Generation with GANs (2024)

**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Training GANs to generate time series of highly dimensional systems that are hard to simulate with a different model.

Highly inspired by [this](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf) pubblication.
