TO DO:
- study TimeGAN code
    - visualization_metrics
    - predictive_metrics

- review Weights & Biases -> [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEGajeVo15ohAQYF1Ttle0lk)
- make cool plots for the model
- setup learning rate schedulers
- train the model

- tests
    - test the synthetic samples against the PCA anomaly detector
    - test the reconstructed samples against the PCA anomaly detector
    - test the discriminator accuracy

- modifications
    - add a second discriminator on the reconstructed samples 

- uninstall
    - wandb
    - pytorch-lightning
    - pyyaml
    - torchvision
    - plotly
    - tensorflow

- write Report
