TO DO:
- study TimeGAN code
    - visualization_metrics
    - discriminative_metrics
    - predictive_metrics

- review Weights & Biases -> [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEGajeVo15ohAQYF1Ttle0lk)
- review cool plots for the model
- Translate TimeGAN
    - to Jupyter
    - to PyTorch
- setup standard format for the model
- make the model
    - should the recovery module have a linear layer at the end? and how to implement it?
- train the model (on better hardware)
    - home computer
    - colab pro 

- uninstall
    - wandb
    - pytorch-lightning
    - pyyaml
    - torchvision
    - plotly
    - tensorflow

- write Report
    - 1) Introduction: section where the problem is presented, and the overall proposed approach is briefly described
    - 2) Related work section
    - 3) Method section, where the main methodology used for the project is described
    - 4) experimental Results (qualitative, quantitative, or both
    - 5) \textbf{discussion and conclusions}.
