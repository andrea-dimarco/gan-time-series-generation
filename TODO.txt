TO DO:
- study TimeGAN code
    - visualization_metrics
    - timegan: Use original time-series data as training set to generater synthetic time-series data
    - main_timegan: Report discriminative and predictive scores for the dataset and t-SNE and PCA analysis
    - utils
    - tutorial_timegan
    - discriminative_metrics
    - predictive_metrics

- review Weights & Biases -> [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEGajeVo15ohAQYF1Ttle0lk)
- review cool plots for the model
- Translate TimeGAN
    - change data types to tensors not python lists!!
    - use a data loader
    - to Jupyter
    - to PyTorch
- setup standard format for the model
- make the model
- train the model (on better hardware)
    - home computer
    - colab pro 

- uninstall
    - wandb
    - pytorch-lightning
    - pyyaml
    - torchvision
    - plotly
